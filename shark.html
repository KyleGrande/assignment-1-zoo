            A shark is a large fish that is known for its cartilaginous skeleton, streamlined body, and sharp teeth. Sharks are found in oceans around the world and come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from the small lantern shark to the massive whale shark. They
            are apex predators and play a vital role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. Sharks are well-adapted to their environment and have several unique features, such as the ability to sense electrical fields, a lateral line system
            that detects movement and vibrations in the water, and the ability to replace their teeth throughout their lives. While some species of sharks can be dangerous to humans, the majority of species are not aggressive towards people and are often
            misunderstood.
