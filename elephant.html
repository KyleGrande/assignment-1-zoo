            An elephant is a large mammal known for its distinctive features such as its trunk, tusks, and large ears. Elephants are the largest land animals and are native to Africa and Asia. They are social animals and live in herds led by a dominant female known
            as the matriarch. Elephants are herbivores and play an important role in their ecosystem by helping to maintain the balance of plant growth. They are considered to be intelligent animals with complex social relationships and have been known
            to demonstrate empathy, self-awareness, and memory.
