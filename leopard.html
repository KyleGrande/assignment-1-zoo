            A leopard is a large wild cat with a distinctive spotted coat that helps it blend into its surroundings. They are found in many parts of Africa and Asia, and are excellent hunters with sharp teeth and powerful limbs. Leopards are solitary animals and
            are known for their agility and strength, capable of carrying prey much heavier than themselves up into trees to keep it away from other predators. They are mostly active at night and are considered to be elusive and secretive animals. Leopards
            are also skilled climbers and swimmers, and are often considered to be one of the most adaptable big cats.
