            A dog is a domesticated mammal and a popular pet known for its loyalty and companionship. There are many breeds of dogs with different sizes, shapes, colors, and temperaments. Dogs have been bred for various purposes, such as hunting, herding, and guarding,
            and have played an important role in human society for thousands of years. They are social animals and require human interaction, exercise, and training to be healthy and happy. Dogs are known for their keen sense of smell and hearing, and
            have been trained to perform a variety of tasks, such as assisting people with disabilities, detecting drugs and explosives, and working with law enforcement.
